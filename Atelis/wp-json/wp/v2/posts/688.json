I am a software engineer who specializes in C# programming. Currently, I work at Detris.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What made you decide to start playing football?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I have always had a passion for football since I was young. Growing up, I was the only girl in my house and compound. Everyone around me loved football, which further fuelled my interest. I also used to play football with my brothers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Did you ever attend a football academy? Could you tell us about your experience if so?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn&#8217;t have the opportunity to attend a football academy until 2013 when I joined an academy in Edo state. In 2019, I signed my first professional contract in Lagos with<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/FC_Robo\"> FC Robo Queens<\/a>. Immediately after completing my national service (NYSC), I wanted to switch teams and earn more money, but <a href=\"http:\/\/decagon.institute\">Decagon<\/a> offered me the chance to learn a new skill and make more money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/NRcX5vjfF0MRu4JAt-VdpGmIFJOXzy5YW156fZcnYtZwrlLIuM8axtH8jGFAQq6Cl1rXTmNJyPp6OmBpKShnl6nq7M1qasV5IYk6kv6YtYk8_ehNDQa3Ytoqgc8jpAJbO3Hc1VovMrLX3J5I-PA3lGsavPM13GCDPi4yjrSVhBgFaW5UZR6RSjqgfEgM1Q\" alt=\"Dorcas Agwogie with FC Robo Queens.\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Dorcas with FC Robo Queens&nbsp;<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What challenges did you face as a female footballer?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a female football player in Nigeria is not an easy journey. The biggest challenge is convincing your parents that football is a suitable activity for a girl. It is not easy because many people don&#8217;t view football as a feminine activity and don&#8217;t believe it is lucrative for female players, as they are not paid as well as male players. This psychological pressure can be challenging and affects me at times.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My parents didn&#8217;t allow me to join an academy earlier because they didn&#8217;t think it was appropriate for a girl to play football. However, seeing other female players do well for themselves and their families inspired me to keep going.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another challenge was trying to join a team. Joining a team in Nigeria can be difficult without someone sponsoring you. I was motivated by watching players who had experienced similar challenges succeed despite these challenges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why did you choose Decagon out of all the boot camps?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I heard about Decagon from my brother, who is also a software engineer. At first, I wasn&#8217;t sure if I had the ability or strength to succeed in a boot camp like Decagon, as I didn&#8217;t consider myself a &#8220;brain type.&#8221; However, I decided to give it a try and went for the interview.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I appreciate about Decagon is that they give people who may not have a foundation in programming the opportunity to learn. I eventually decided to attend and I am now grateful that I did.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/MBnXnSw7mmbyqh-NbSp03rGKshVuI7Rt2cxpYYTn-ePd3g-m12RfF0Q_ggtj1KSs_5rOCy2QLzvPVj7XLuBhfPXXf5tgabbXMYhEWSSKCe4CF3usOR_cedS3_KhRRLM7TI8DJzCwOv_7QJ3fGXF-euvQizinTry7n3g2EvBkSKWslRNOhvrqMz_56pHQLw\" alt=\"Dorcas Agwogie during her Decadev days.\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Dorcas during her Decadev days&nbsp;<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How did you feel when you were accepted into Decagon?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I had mixed feelings when I was accepted into Decagon. I was happy and sad at the same time. I almost deferred my admission because I wasn&#8217;t sure I would be able to adapt to the program. Moving from a physical activity to something that required more mental effort was a big change for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Decagon made me feel like I could achieve anything as long as I put in the effort. I eventually decided to attend and ended up being the last person in my cohort to resume. I also needed the money and felt it would help me as a footballer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What impact has Decagon had on your life decisions in terms of major life changes?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Decagon has given me the belief that there is nothing I can&#8217;t achieve as long as I put in the effort. The fact that I was able to learn tech within six months is a testament to this. When I tell people about the things I learned at Decagon, they are often surprised and assume that I have been in tech for years. The skills I gained from Decagon have also greatly improved my CV, and when people find out that I am a football player as well, they are even more impressed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decagon has opened up new opportunities for me and has helped me see that there are other things I can do besides football. Decagon has also improved my mental health and confidence. I am now more skilled and financially stable, and my parents are happy that I have learned a new skill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Can you describe your post-Decagon experience? How has it been?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I miss the environment and amenities at Decagon. Everything was provided for us, including networking opportunities, food, and more. We didn&#8217;t have to worry about cooking or cleaning, which I have to do now that I am home. Despite this, I still keep in touch with my friends from Decagon and consider them family. We have all come out of the program more professional than when we started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>In today&#8217;s world, how will you juggle being a tech sis with being a footballer?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While learning at Decagon, I still found time to go for football training within and outside the facility. According to my coach, tech skills will give me an edge but shouldn&#8217;t prevent me from playing football. I believe that if people like <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chioma_Ajunwa\">Chioma Ajunwa<\/a> could balance a career in sports with a profession like being a policewoman, then I can do both tech and football. In fact, most tech jobs are remote, so I will have the flexibility to continue playing football professionally while working in tech.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/pwdRDUmJs_Jh-8-rdg7idBXIOKp-TpoGz89eZpdK28NeG3195Gj1cnv44lhb-o0RUUuCrZeAXbmmX7NEJzWJra98upI8TEy4vbiXiheRLh-IXBgciSU3NVInk0kbggR_RAUPGXkONckwaRv1wAfmZ4x5yhT3PnaZsK6xzOrCBF1VWX4aF-y_pLE5_zs7lA\" alt=\"Dorcas Agwogie during her training session.\n\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Dorcas during her training session&nbsp;<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Where do you see yourself in the next few years?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the next few years, I hope to own my own tech company. To do this, I need to make money and continue learning in both tech and football. Even in football, technology is becoming more important, as seen with the use of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Video_assistant_referee\">VAR <\/a>(Video Assistant Referee). Even if I am not playing, I can use my tech skills to implement new technological advancements in football.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>If you could change one thing about your childhood, what would it be?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If I could change one thing about my childhood, it would be to start playing football earlier. Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t have the opportunity to do so when I was younger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>One word to people who want to join Decagon?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t think twice, just join.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Trivia segment:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h4>Messi or Ronaldo?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Messi, because he is the real GOAT (Greatest of All Time).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Chelsea or Man United?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Chelsea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Dollar or Pounds?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Pounds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>TikTok or Instagram?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Instagram.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>WhatsApp or Twitter?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>WhatsApp.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Facebook or LinkedIn?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>LinkedIn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What advice do you have for aspiring female footballers and software engineers?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For aspiring female footballers, my advice is to never give up on your dreams. For aspiring software engineers, my advice is to never be afraid to try something new. Decagon has shown me that with hard work and determination, anyone can learn tech. Don&#8217;t let anyone tell you that you can&#8217;t do it. Believe in yourself and go for it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Thank you for sharing your inspiring story, Dorcas. It&#8217;s amazing to see how you have excelled in both football and tech. We wish you the best in all your future endeavors.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you too. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also become a Tech sis like Dorcas Agwogie.
